 Popcorn Hour C200 Web Remote Control v1.0-0001
------------------------------------------------------------
This app allows you to remote control a C200 via a web page.
Use your favorite web device, be it an iPhone, a browser on
a PC or whatever you prefer, to send commands directly to
the C200 over the network.

------------------------------------------------------------
 License
------------------------------------------------------------
The application is released under the WTFPL terms. 

A failure to comply with the terms will result in vulgar 
indifference.

Any contribution or cheer will be seriously appreciated.

------------------------------------------------------------
 Usage
------------------------------------------------------------
Install and start the app via CSI and point your browser to:
http://<your nmt ip address>:9999/c200remote_web/

------------------------------------------------------------
 Disclaimer
------------------------------------------------------------
The commands are not 100% working. Some may not be usable in
all situations. An example is the PREV (previous) to skip
back in a playlist of music tracks or photos.

Another is the EJECT that slides out the disc tray, but it
might require another command, for instance pressing source,
before it allows you to slide the tray back in.

Other known commands that are not working yet are:
- Complete shutdown (Power Off)
- Reboot

And there might be more, but most actually work fine.

------------------------------------------------------------
